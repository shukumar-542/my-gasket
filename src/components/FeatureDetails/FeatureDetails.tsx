          <span className="font-bold">Thickness limitations :</span> While nylon
          PA12 is ideal for many 3D printing projects, it has limitations when
          it comes to thicker parts or very massive components. This may require
          more careful design or the use of specialised printing techniques.

            Parts with large flat surfaces can deform:{" "}
          </span>
          During the 3D printing process, the material is heated and if
          different parts of the part cool at different speeds, this can
          generate internal tensions in the material. These tensions can cause
          parts of the part that cool faster to bend or warp, creating
          deformations especially with large flat surfaces. In order to avoid
          warping, post-production work or design adaptation may be required to
          ensure dimensional stability
